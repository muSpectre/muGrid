   * To understand the interface, it is important to clarify the following
   * nomenclature:
   * - `Pixels` are the grid dimensions for global fields or a single linear
   * dimension for local fields
   * - `SubPts` specify the number of (tensor) quantities held per pixel. These
   * could for example be quadrature points.
   * - `Components` are the components of the physical tensor quantity
   * represented by the field.
